# IBPS

This project is designed to implement concepts studied in HTML, CSS, JS during #100DaysOfCode.

IBPS is "Institute of Banking Personnel" which conducts recruitment process for Indias nationalised banks. The recruitment process consist of Preliminary Exam, Mains Exam, Interview.

Before conducting exams candidates required to registere for exam and this project shows how students register themself. Though some steps are removed in this project which are repeated.

For example, In actual registration process you have to enter First Name, Middle Name, Last name, Email twice. So to avoid repeatation I have used "Full Name" category to enter candidates full name. Candidates have to enter full name only ones. 

The registration process has three phases. First, temporary registration. After completion of first phase candidate will get SMS and Email provided during first phase, conatains Registration Number, Roll Number, Password. Second, candidate need to upload passport size photo, signature, enter educational qualification etc. Third, candidate need to submit application after payment of fees. After payment user can not edit the application.
